		<h2>What is a Carbon Footprint?</h2>

			<p id="text">A carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gases—primarily carbon dioxide—released into the atmosphere by a particular human activity. </p>

			<p id="text">When calculating a carbon footprint, a lot of factors are taken into consideration. For example, driving to the grocery store burns a certain amount of fuel, and fossil fuels are the primary sources of greenhouses gases. But that grocery store is powered by electricity, and its employees probably drove to work, so the store has its own carbon footprint. In addition, the products that the store sells were all shipped there, so that must also be factored into the total carbon footprint. Beyond that, the fruits, vegetables, and meats that the store sells were all grown or raised on farms, a process that produces methane, which has a greenhouse effect 25 times greater than CO2. All of those elements must be combined to understand the full carbon footprint of a given activity. </p>

			<h2>Think Before Throwing It Away!</h2>

			<p id="text">Got old clothes, malfunctioning computers or broken home appliances you’re planning to trash? The majority of your discarded items make their way into one of the numerous landfills across the country. Reconsider it - not only because they could have been reused or recycled. Neither because there are better uses for the space landfills occupy or because transporting your discarded items is costly. You see, all of that waste in landfills doesn’t just lie there forever. It decomposes. As it does, it releases landfill gas, a toxic brew of air pollutants that includes the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane.</p>

			<p id="text">The majority of landfill gas is simply vented into the atmosphere. In fact, landfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Methane is known to be 28 times more efficient than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. That means it poses a huge global warming problem.</p>

			<h2>What You Can Do</h2>

			<p id="text">The rules are simple enough: reuse and repair. By keeping your repairable items out of landfills, you can help make a positive impact on the environment. Repair Hero's goal is to provide services to those with items in need of repair and to provide jobs to those who can repair. In doing so, we can all contribute to reducing our carbon footprint and in turn the effect of greenhouse gases and other emissions on our environment. It can be difficult to achieve alone, but through the network we aim to provide, being more environmentally aware becomes far easier! </p>
